     <p>Television is a fantastic educational tool. It broadens knowledge of different cultures, promotes tolerance and global understanding of international issues. Through current affairs, discovery, lifestyle, cooking shows and children's programmes, television encourages scientific and cultural curiosity.
        Television is one of the most popular sources of entertainment and information about the world. The word television comes from the ancient Greek word “tele”, meaning far and the Latin word “visio”, which means sight. TV was coined as a short form for television in 1948. Television in the old days used CRT monitors.
        “Researchers have found that moderate to high television viewing during midlife is associated with increased memory loss and decreased fine motor skills,” explains Manisha Parulekar, M.D., director, division of Geriatrics, and co-director, Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center. </p>
